# GAN

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a powerful class of neural networks that are used for unsupervised learning.

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can be broken down into three parts:
1. Generative: To learn a generative model, which describes how data is generated in terms of a probabilistic model.
2. Adversarial: The training of a model is done in an adversarial setting.
3. Networks: Use deep neural networks as artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms for training purposes.

In GANs, there is a **Generator** and a **Discriminator**. 

The Generator generates fake samples of data(be it an image, audio, etc.) and tries to fool the Discriminator. The Discriminator, on the other hand, tries to distinguish between the real and fake samples. The Generator and the Discriminator are both Neural Networks and they both run in competition with each other in the training phase. The steps are repeated several times and in this, the Generator and Discriminator get better and better in their respective jobs after each repetition.
